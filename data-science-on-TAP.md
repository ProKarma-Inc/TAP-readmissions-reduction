## Overview

This intent is for this repo to be a one-stop source for everything you need to take your own hospital patient data, load that data into TAP, extract and process the relevant features, and train a model to predict which patients are likely to be readmitted within some amount of time.

This tutorial takes as given that you have access to a running TAP VPC (version 0.7), have access to patient data in CSV format, have permissions to upload data to the HDFS data catalog, and can create Jupyter notebook instances.

Additionally, there are several assumptions about skills and familiarity with technology, specifically:
  * You are familiar with iPython or Jupyter notebooks.
  * You are familiar with Spark
  * You can write SQL queries

1. First, we will cover how to upload patient data to the Data Catalog.
2. Second, we will demonstrate how to create a Jupyter notebook running Pyspark and load the patient data for analysis.
3. Next, we will select a classifier model to identify patients at risk of readmission.
4. Then, we will discuss how to tune model parameters, evaluate the model's performance, and discuss common risks and 'gotchas' to be aware of when modeling.
5. Finally, we will show how to deploy the model as a REST api so that medical staff can begin identifying which patients are most at risk of readmission.         

# 1. Loading the data into the Data Catalog

First, log in to the console for your TAP VPC. It should look something like this:

![Data Catalog](images/data-catalog.png)

To load your data, select the "Submit Transfer" tab. You upload data files directly from your local machine or you can pass a link. You can also `ssh` or `sftp` into `cdh-launcher` and from there you can directly interact with the nodes of the Hadoop cluster via the `hdfs` command (e.g. `put` files directly into HDFS). For our purposes, uploading data to the Data Catalog with the browser based console is probably the quickest and easiest way.

For this exercise, I am using the MIMIC-III dataset, which can be accessed at: https://mimic.physionet.org/

In this case, the data we are using are called `ADMISSIONS.csv`, `PATIENTS.csv`, and `DRGCODES.csv`.<sup>Note 1</sup> If you are using your own organization's data, I have provided a brief description of the above files and why we want to use them. You can find the analogous tables in your own organization.

a. `ADMISSIONS.csv` - contains the unique patient id (`SUBJECT_ID`), unique admission id (`HADM_ID`), the type of admissions (e.g. `EMERGENCY`, `ELECTIVE`, `NEWBORN` etc.), time of patient admission (`ADMITTIME`), time of patient discharge (`DISCHTIME`) and some socioeconomic and demographic features like `ETHNICITY`, `LANGUAGE`, `INSURANCE`, and
`ADMIT_TYPE`, etc.

b. `PATIENTS.csv` - contains features like the patient's id (`SUBJECT_ID`), gender (`GENDER`), date of birth (`DOB`) from which we can derive the patient's age at a given hospital admission.

c. `DRGCODES.csv` - contains the comorbidity features `DRG_MORTALITY` and `DRG_SEVERITY`. These are data that essentially represent how severe, complicated, and dangerous a patient's condition is. 

Name the files whatever you want to call them and give them any appropriate labels, e.g. Healthcare.

Click "Upload" and wait. 

You will have to do steps 3. and 4. for each file you want to upload to the Data Catalog.

# 2. Create a Jupyter (iPython) notebook and load data into Spark 

Click on the "Data Science" tab on the right side of the console Dash Board. Click on the "Jupyter" tab.

![Creating a Jupyter Notebook](images/jupyter.png)

Give your notebook a name and click on the "Create New Instance" button. It can take a few seconds while the Docker host spins up a container running your Jupyter notebook.

TAP uses the standard Anaconda distribution for iPython, but you can click on the "Help" tab to verify that a battle tested scientific toolkit (e.g. `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib` etc.) is available and ready to use.

![A Brand New Jupyter Notebook](images/ipython.png)

*Note:* If there is a package that you want to use that is not available just run `!pip install myPackage`.

Start by making some standard `pyspark` imports:
```python
from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
from pyspark.sql import SQLContext
```

Since we are working with csv files the `spark-csv` package is extremely useful ([spark-csv docs here](https://github.com/databricks/spark-csv)). Specifically, it allows us to read csv files directly into DataFrames and enables labor saving features like automatically inferring schema. The default version of Spark for TAP 0.7 is Spark 1.5.0 which does not have spark-csv as part of the standard toolkit, so it must be passed using the `--packages` parameter of `spark-submit`:

```python
import os

import os
os.environ['PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS'] = "--packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.10:1.4.0 pyspark-shell"
os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = "python2.7"
```
Notice that we also explicitly pass the `client` for the `--deploy-mode` argument. This will allow us to use spark in the cell based REPL workflow that makes Jupyter notebooks so useful for data analysis.

**Note:** For exploratory data analysis and investigating a dataset I prefer to use `spark-submit` to set the parameters for the SparkContext. You can also edit the `spark-defaults.conf` to edit the defaults, adjusting parameters like `--num-executors`, `--driver-memory`, `--executor-memory`, and `--num-executors`, etc. The `SparkConf` object also gives you control over the specific resources and properties your Spark application has. You can read more [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html).  

Let's create the `SparkContext` and the `SQLContext`. `SQLContext` allows us to create Spark DataFrames, enabling us to use SQL queries against our dataframes. DataFrames also allow us to use `pandas` style dataframe operations when it is more appropriate. Additionally, you can use `map`, `filter`, `reduceByKey`, `flatMap`, etc. on dataframes, just like you can with RDDs. 

```python
# Create the SparkContext
conf = SparkConf()
conf.setMaster('yarn-client')
conf.set('spark.driver.memory', '2g')
conf.set('spark.executor.memory', '2g')
conf.set('spark.executor.cores', 4)
conf.set('spark.executor.instances', 4)

sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)
# Tungsten is the built-in code execution optimizer. It should be on by default, but make sure it is on.
sqlContext.setConf("spark.sql.tungsten.enabled", "true")
```
In order to load our `CSV` files, we need the HDFS uris for our files from the Data Catalog. Click on the **Data Catalog** tab of the TAP Console and ensure you are viewing the **Data sets** subtab. From here, click on the filename of the `CSV` files you want to load into Spark. Once you click on the filename, you should see a **targetUri** that is very long and looks something like this: 

![Finding file URIs in the Data Catalog](images/hdfs-uri.png)

The below URIs are palacehodlers. Copy and paste the **targetUri** for each file in the **Data Catalog** that you want to load:
```python
hdfsPathAdmissions = "hdfs://nameservice1/path-to-my-file-1"
hdfsPathPatients = "hdfs://nameservice1/path-to-my-file-2"
hdfsPathCodes = "hdfs://nameservice1/path-to-my-file-3"
```
* Use `spark-csv` to load the `CSV` files into Spark DataFrames:
```python
df_admissions = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').\
                                options(header='true', inferSchema=True).\
                                load(hdfsPathAdmissions)

df_patients = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').\
                                options(header='true', inferSchema=True).\
                                load(hdfsPathPatients)

df_drgcodes = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').\
                                options(header='true', inferSchema=True).\
                                load(hdfsPathCodes)
```
* Check the schema to make sure that data types and column names are what you want:
```python
df_admissions.printSchema()

root
 |- ROW_ID: integer (nullable = true)
 |- SUBJECT_ID: integer (nullable = true)
 |- HADM_ID: integer (nullable = true)
 |- ADMITTIME: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |- DISCHTIME: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |- DEATHTIME: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |- ADMISSION_TYPE: string (nullable = true)
 |- ADMISSION_LOCATION: string (nullable = true)
 |- DISCHARGE_LOCATION: string (nullable = true)
 |- INSURANCE: string (nullable = true)
 |- LANGUAGE: string (nullable = true)
 |- RELIGION: string (nullable = true)
 |- MARITAL_STATUS: string (nullable = true)
 |- ETHNICITY: string (nullable = true)
 |- EDREGTIME: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |- EDOUTTIME: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |- DIAGNOSIS: string (nullable = true)
 |- HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG: integer (nullable = true)
 |- HAS_IOEVENTS_DATA: integer (nullable = true)
 |- HAS_CHARTEVENTS_DATA: integer (nullable = true)
```
**Note:** If the schema is not what you want, you can always pass an explicit schema, instead of using the inferschema option ([creating a schema](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#programmatically-specifying-the-schema)).
Another option is to create new columns of the right type that are derived from the columns that were incorrectly cast. It is important to keep in mind that Spark dataframes and RDDs are immutable objects, so you cannot cast an existing object to a different type, you have to create an entire new column with a different name.

We can register our `ADMISSIONS` dataframe as the table `admissions` -- enabling us to query it with SQL:
```python
sqlContext.registerDataFrameAsTable(df_admissions, "admissions")
threeRows = sqlContext.sql("SELECT * FROM admissions LIMIT 3")
threeRows.show()

We have now loaded the data that we intend to work with. In the next section we will begin processing in preparation for modeling.

# 3. Data Processing

Looking at our admission table, we know that there is unique entry for each hospital admission. In this table the unique `SUBJECT_ID` can show up multiple times -- corresponding to distinct hospital admissions (`HADM_ID`).

Let's find the number of admissions for each patient.
```python
q1 = """SELECT SUBJECT_ID, COUNT(*) AS NUM_ADMISSIONS 
        FROM admissions 
        GROUP BY SUBJECT_ID"""
```
We can create a new DataFrame `admissionCounts` that is the result of running the above SQL query. Notice, that nothing happens because we have not yet asked Spark to perform any action. We are merely describing a set of transformations that Spark will perform once we actually take an action and ask for a result.
```python
admissionCounts = sqlContext.sql(q1)
admissionCounts.show(7)

```
Here I register a new table 'admissionCounts' to keep things simple. SQL subqueries do not always work in SparkSQL, so registering a DataFrame as a table or aliasing is often both easier and the only way to actually subselect in SparkSQL. Also, the "tables" do not occupy any additional memory since they are not created until an action is taken that requires the data.
```python
sqlContext.registerDataFrameAsTable(admissionCounts, "admissioncounts")
```
Let's focus on identifying the patients that were readmitted.
```python
q2 = """SELECT a.ROW_ID, a.SUBJECT_ID, a.HADM_ID, a.ADMITTIME, a.DISCHTIME, b.NUM_ADMISSIONS
        FROM admissions AS a, admissioncounts AS b

Let's calculate the patient's age, I rounded the age to 1 decimal place to account for any a more granular representation of the qualitative differences in health that may exist between between really young children (i.e. < 3 months) and slightly older -- but perhaps more healthy -- young children (i.e. 6-12 months).

Let's take a quick look at the distribution of age among the patients. The collect method can take a while with large data sets any you should be careful to not collect so much data that you overflow your driver memory.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# We will sample 20% of our data to get a sense of the age distribution.
ages = [age[0] for age in data.select(data.AGE).sample(withReplacement=False, fraction=0.2).collect()]

plt.hist(ages, bins=30)

plt.ylabel('Counts', size=20)
plt.xlabel('Age', size=20)

This chart shows a bimodal distribution that appears to be centered around newborns and the normal adult population, with essentially no instances of other children.

It is worth nothing is that `EMERGENCY` readmissions rates are nearly twice as high as the other classes, indicating that 'ADMISSION_TYPE' is likely to be a useful feature. 

From here we can see that `NEWBORN` patients have a significantly lower readmission rate -- which is good, but these are probably not the people we want to focus on. Therefore, I will remove the instances of `NEWBORN` because I intend to focus on adressing readmissions for adults. My intution is that newborns may have an unexpected effect of boosting accuracy of a classifier in such a way that does not generalize to the adult population.

```python
adultsDF = data.filter(data.ADMISSION_TYPE != 'NEWBORN')
sqlContext.registerDataFrameAsTable(adultsDF, "adults")
```

Let's see what the imbalance is between the people who were readmitted within 30 days and those wo were not

```python
sqlContext.sql("""SELECT
                    AVG(CASE
                        WHEN DAYS_TO_READMISSION > 0 and DAYS_TO_READMISSION <= 30 THEN 1
                        ELSE 0

"""
```
From this result we can see that this is a heavily imbalanced class -- about 1 patient is readmitted within 30 days for 23 patients that are not. This imbalance in the target will also pose problems to any classifier that is sensitive to class imbalance, e.g. Logistic Regression and Random Forest

One way we can handle this is to oversample from the minority class -- those who were readmitted -- until they are represented in roughly the same proportion as the those who were not readmitted. There are some sophisticated techniques for doing this such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). We will have to address this during model training and cross-validation.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import *

labelBinner = udf(lambda days: 1.0 if (days > 0) and (days <= 30) else 0.0, DoubleType())
labeledData = adultsDF.withColumn('label', labelBinner(adultsDF.DAYS_TO_READMISSION))
```

We will seperate the data into a dataset that can be used training and validation with a holdout set that will not be used for any training purposes. This holdout data will serve as a final sanity check that our validated model generalizes to new data. 

Finally, we save the data.

```python
adults, holdout = labeledData.randomSplit([0.9, 0.1])

# There is a known bug in Spark 1.5 that causes writing DataFrames to CSV to fail when Tungsten is enabled.
sqlContext.setConf("spark.sql.tungsten.enabled", "false")

adults.coalesce(1).write.format("com.databricks.spark.csv").\
                          option("header", "true").\
                          save("adults.csv")
        
holdout.coalesce(1).write.format("com.databricks.spark.csv").\
                          option("header", "true").\
                          save("holdout.csv")
```

# 4. Training, Testing, and Validating a Machine Learning Model

Import the modeling data and do some preliminary checks before we start modeling.

```python
df_adults = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').\
                                options(header='true', inferSchema=True).\
                                load('adults.csv')

df_holdout = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').\
                                options(header='true', inferSchema=True).\
                                load('holdout.csv')

# Print the schema to make sure that our data were loaded as the correct type.

print("We have %d training instances and %d holdout instances." % (df_adults.count(), df_holdout.count()))
"""

"""
```

In this case, `AVG_DRG_SEVERITY` and `AVG_DRG_MORTALITY` have been read in as strings instead of doubles. This will need to be corrected before we do any modeling. You never know and should always check if `null` values are present.  

```python
# We will cast these string variables as double types
intermediateDF = df_adults.withColumn("AVG_SEVERITY", df_adults.AVG_DRG_SEVERITY.cast(DoubleType()))
adults = intermediateDF.withColumn("AVG_MORTALITY", intermediateDF.AVG_DRG_MORTALITY.cast(DoubleType()))
```

We handled the only missing values earlier, so the next step just a pre-modleing check that is good practice. Most algorithms do not handle missing data and will throw an exception -- requireing you to replace those missing values with something. 


```python
# Prints the name of the column that has any missing values.
for col in df_adults.columns:
    if df_adults.where(df_adults[col].isNull()).count() > 0:
        print col
```
There is an entire sub-field of data analysis devoted to imputation of missing data, however, three common methods for imputing missing values are using the mean or median value of a column, replacing it with zero, or dropping it entirely. You can also perform tests to see if the missing values are missing at random or if there is a statisitcally significant number of missing values -- thereby necessitating a prudent imputation strategy, e.g. mean, median, or fitting a model that can identify a pattern from the other data fields to try and learn what is likely to be a good value for the missing fields.  

The last step we want to take before starting the modeling process is to encode categorical variables. Many classifiers can handle cariables that are categorical as well as continuous. An example of a categorical variables is `GENDER` which -- in this dataset -- can only take the values of `M` or `F`. An example of a continuous variable is `AGE` which can take any value greater than 0. To encode `GENDER`, `M` can be represented by a `0` and `F` can be represented by a `1`. 

PySpark has a built-in feature called `StringIndexer` that can be very useful for this purpose. The `StringIndexer` will take as input a column of string valued rows and replace them with numerical values, e.g. all instances of `Cat` are replaced with a `0.0` and `Dog` with a `1.0`.

I am choosing to not use this feature because `StringIndexer` will repalce the most frequently encounter value with `0.0` and the next most frequent value with `1.0`, and so on. Since some of my categorical features are very uncommon, they may not be present in both the training and validation data, thereby causing `StringIndexer` to represent them differently each type it is applied. To ensure consistency in how categorical values are encoded, I will manually specify the encodings.

We can use SparkSQL to do this.

```python
# Write a query that will encode all categorical variables as numeric for a given table
categoricalEncodingQuery =  """

Now we are ready to train an initial model.

```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier

rfc = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol="indexedLabel", featuresCol="features")
```

The Spark `Pipeline` object allows us to string together different transformers and estimators into a pipeline that can be applied repeatedly to different datasets.

```python
train, test = encodedData.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])
print("We have %d training instances and %d validation instances." % (train.count(), test.count()))
"""

from pyspark.ml import Pipeline

rfcPipeline = Pipeline(stages=[assembler, labelIndexer, rfc])

# Create an initial Random Forest model
initialModel = rfcPipeline.fit(train)
```

With a trained model let's create a set of predictions and score them.

```python
# Create an initial set of prediction.
initialPredictions = initialModel.transform(test)

collected = initialPredictions.select('probability', 'label').collect()

# Creating a list of tuples with probabilities and labels, 
# e.g. [(prob1, label1), (prob2, label2), ...]. 
# Be sure to convert the prob value from a numpy float to a regular float,
# otherwise the PySpark BinaryClassificatioMetrics will throw a datatype exception.

scoreLabelPairs = [(float(row[0][1]), row[1]) for row in collected]

# Create an RDD from the scores and labels
scoresAndLabels = sc.parallelize(scoreLabelPairs, 2)

from pyspark.mllib.evaluation import BinaryClassificationMetrics

metrics = BinaryClassificationMetrics(scoresAndLabels)
print "Area Under the ROC Curve: ", metrics.areaUnderROC

Model training can take a while depending on the size of your data, how many trees you want in your ensemble, and the depth that you allow your trees to go. In general, you want each tree to be constructed to the maximum depth permissable by your time and computational resources. This will inherently overfit your data on any given tree, but since your are constructing many different trees from random bootstrapped samples of the data, each tree is overfitting in a slightly different way. A given prediction is made when a datapoint is fed through each tree in the forest and the tree votes on the classification for that datapoint. The votes are tallied and a prediction is made by taking the majority vote of the trees. The end result is that the high variance between individual trees will average out over the entire forest.

We will now demonstrate how to tune one model paramter while also demonstrating how to prevent overfitting your data.

```python
trainData, testData = encodedData.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])
print("We have %d training instances and %d validation instances." % (trainData.count(), testData.count()))
"""

    rfc = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol="indexedLabel", featuresCol="features", maxDepth=depth)

With the scores for the models trained with different depth settings we will plot the results.

![Random Forest Overfitting](images/rf-overfitting.png)

The blue line shows us that the model performs better and better on the training data as the depth is increased. The red line tell us a different story. It shows us that the model perforamnce is increasing slightly until it peaks at a `maxDepth` of 6. After that, the performance on the test data begins to fall off. This is not suprprising because deep trees are getting close to perfectly describing the training dataset but failing to generalize to unseen data. This is the definition of overfitting. 

## Balance the data

To avoid overfitting we will perform K-fold cross validation on our data.

But before we do that, let's address the imabalanced class problem that we identified earleir. We will use the `imbalanced-learn` python library to write a helper function that takes a PySpark DataFrame, applies `SMOTE` to balance the classes, and returns a new PySpark DataFrame. 

```python
!pip install imbalanced-learn
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

def balance_data(pySparkDataFrame):
    
    df = pySparkDataFrame.toPandas()
    X = df.drop(['days_to_readmission', 'label'], axis=1)
    y = df['label']
    sm = SMOTE()
    X_sampled, y_sampled = sm.fit_sample(X, y)

    # Now we need to convert the synethically generated training data from a numpy array to a pandas DF
    # and add the column names back in.
    df_smote = pd.DataFrame(X_sampled, columns=df.columns[:-2])
    df_smote['label'] = y_sampled
    # The only thing left to do is to put the column round of the synethically generated categorical variabels.

    for col in categoricalCols:
        df_smote[col] = np.round(df_smote[col])

    # Now convert back to a Spark DataFrame
    balancedData = sqlContext.createDataFrame(df_smote)
    return balancedData
```

```python
numTrees = [15, 20, 25]
maxDepths = [6, 8, 12]
kFolds = 5

# Grid search with cross-validation
for trees in numTrees:
    for depth in maxDepths:
        scores = []
        for fold in xrange(kFolds):
            train, test = encodedData.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])
            rfc = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol="indexedLabel", featuresCol="features")
            pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[assembler, labelIndexer, rfc])
            balancedTrain = balance_data(train)
            cvModel = pipeline.fit(balancedTrain)
            metrics = score_binary_model(cvModel, test)
            scores.append(metrics.areaUnderROC)

        print "Trees: ", trees, "Depth: ", depth, "Area Under ROC Curve", float(sum(scores))/len(scores)

```

Now we will use the optimized paramters to create our production `RandomForest` model using the entire body of training data.

One of the reasons for using the `RDD` based `RandomForest` model is that this particular version of Spark only allows a `model.save()` method that enables us to serialze the trained model and then recover it later for deployment in an application. The newer version of Spark (>= Spark 2.0) enable this functionality for a wider variety of models. 

One of the nice properties of Random Forest is the ability to handle categorical variables as well as continuous variables. We can just use the categorical variables as they are right now, e.g. {0, 1, 2, ...}, and the model can work with them, however the model will assume that they are continuous unless otherwise specified. This is exactly what the `categoricalFeaturesInfo` paramter of the `model.train()` method is for. MLlib asks for a data structure called an arity for `categoricalFeaturesInfo`. This just means that we need to give the model a dictionary of the column indexes (0-based) with the number of distinct categorical values in that column.

Here is how we construct the arity.

```python
# Construct the arity for the RDD based classifier

# The features that are assembled into the vector
featureCols = ['admission_type', 'insurance', 'gender', 'ethn', 'lang', 
               'status', 'avg_severity', 'avg_mortality', 'age']

# Specifies which features are categorical
categoricalCols = ['admission_type', 'insurance', 'gender', 'ethn', 'lang', 'status']

catFeatureInfo = {}

for col in categoricalCols:
    ix = featureCols.index(col)
    numVals = encodedData.select(col).distinct().count()
    catFeatureInfo[ix] = numVals
    
print catFeatureInfo
# The key is the 0-based index of the categorical column and the value is the 
# number of values the categorical column can take.
"""
{0: 3, 1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 6, 4: 3, 5: 6}
"""
```

Now we have to build an RDD of LabeledPoints for input into the `RandomForest`.

```python
from pyspark.mllib.regression import LabeledPoint

# Construct the RDD of labeled points, e.g. a labeled point is an object with a structure like (label, featureVector)
balancedTrain = balance_data(encodedData)
vectorsTrain = assembler.transform(labelIndexer.fit(encodedData).transform(balancedTrain))
labeledPointsTrain = vectorsTrain.select("indexedLabel", "features")
trainingData = labeledPointsTrain.map(lambda row: LabeledPoint(row.indexedLabel, row.features))

# Show a few of the labeled points.
trainingData.take(5)
# The second point looks different because it has multiple zero value and is represented as a SparseVector. 
# RandomForest works with either DenseVectors or SparseVectors.
"""
[LabeledPoint(0.0, [0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,76.3]),
 LabeledPoint(0.0, (9,[2,6,7,8],[1.0,3.0,2.0,49.9])),
 LabeledPoint(0.0, [2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,72.6]),
 LabeledPoint(0.0, [2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,59.5]),
 LabeledPoint(0.0, [0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,73.2])]
"""
```

### Build the production model

```python
from pyspark.mllib.tree import RandomForest

numPts = trainingData.count()
trainPts = sc.parallelize(trainingData.take(numPts))

# Use the optimized paramters
trees = 20
depth = 6

rfcProd = RandomForest()
model = rfcProd.trainClassifier(data=trainPts,
                                numClasses=2,
                                categoricalFeaturesInfo=catFeatureInfo,
                                numTrees=trees,
                                maxDepth=depth,
                                impurity='gini',
                                seed=42)
```

Now let's make predictions on the final holdout data and validate the results.

```python
encodedHoldoutData = sqlContext.sql(categoricalEncodingQuery.format("holdout"))
vectorsHoldout = assembler.transform(labelIndexer.fit(encodedData).transform(encodedHoldoutData))
labeledPointsHoldout = vectorsHoldout.select("indexedLabel", "features")
holdoutData = labeledPointsHoldout.map(lambda row: LabeledPoint(row.indexedLabel, row.features))
probs = predict_proba(model, labeledPointsHoldout)

from pyspark.mllib.evaluation import BinaryClassificationMetrics

labels = labeledPointsHoldout.map(lambda lp: lp.indexedLabel).collect()
scoreLabelPairs = izip(probs, labels)
scoresAndLabels = sc.parallelize(scoreLabelPairs, 2)
metrics = BinaryClassificationMetrics(scoresAndLabels)

print "AUROC of the production model on holdout data: ", metrics.areaUnderROC

"""
AUROC of the production model on holdout data:  0.612757116451
"""

```

# 5. Deploying the Model
Once we are satisified with the performance of our model we want to put it into production. To do that we use the `model.save()` method to serialize the model and write it to HDFS.

```python
# Change the modelName to whatever you want the file name to be in HDFS
modelName = "rf-model-30day.dat"
model.save(modelName)
"""
```

With the model saved, we can write a Flask application that instantiates the saved model and deploys it as a restful service via Cloud Foundry. The service can then accept data points over http and return predictions for use in an application. The code and documentation for this can be found at: https://github.com/ProKarma-Inc/TAP-readmissions-reduction/tree/master/src/data-APIs/risk-scorer

**Note 1**: We also have access to a rich set of electronic chart data that contains entries for daily blood pressure, heart rate, various types of urinalysis data, and thousands of other medical results and biomarker data. I have deliberately not included this data for the reason that for any given type of entry on the electronic record only a subset of the patients have that specific type of data record. For example, there are over 40,000 unique patients comprising nearly 59,000 unique admissions. If I want to train a model that uses features such as heart rate, body weight, and blood pressure data, I need to find the set of patients such that most of the patients have that heart rate AND body weight AND blood pressure data. As you add more features, the set of patients that have all of those features quickly becomes smaller and smaller. There are many ways you can address this shortcoming such as imputation of missing values, or only selecting chart data that nearly all the patients have in their record. I chose to use comorbidity info (contained in `DRGCODES.csv`) because it can be thought of as a lower dimensional representation of the many different biomarkers that come along with a given diagnosis.
